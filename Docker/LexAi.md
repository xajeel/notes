# LexAi Application Dockerizing 

Create a `Dockerfile` in the root directory of the project. Then add the following lines in the `Dockerfile`.

```docker 
FROM python:3.10-slim

WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt .

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y git pkg-config default-mysql-client libmariadb-dev gcc python3-dev

RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

COPY . .

EXPOSE 5000

ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1

CMD ["python", "main.py"]

```

---

## File Explanation

- Getting python image with particular version.

``` docker
FROM python:3.10-slim
```
- Setting a working directory

```docker
WORKDIR /app
```
- Copy the `requirements.txt` file to the working directory `/app`

```docker
COPY requirements.txt .
```
- Installing dependencies used in the project.

```docker
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y git pkg-config default-mysql-client libmariadb-dev gcc python3-dev
```
- Installing `requirements` of the application

```docker
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
```
- Copying all the remaining files to the `/app` directory

```docker
COPY . .
```
- Exposing a specific port for the application 

```docker
EXPOSE 5000
```
- Setting python environment variable (optional)

```docker
ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1
```
- Running the CMD command that will run the application 

```docker
CMD ["python", "main.py"]
```

## Building Image

- The command `docker build -t flask_app .` is used to build a Docker image from a Dockerfile in the current directory.

```docker
docker build -t flask_app .
```
`docker`: This is the command-line interface for interacting with Docker.

`build`: This command tells Docker to build an image. It processes the instructions in the Dockerfile and creates a Docker image from it.

`-t flask_app`: The -t option allows you to tag the image with a name. In this case, the image will be tagged as flask_app. 

You can think of this as naming the image, which will be useful when you later run or manage the image. The tag is optional, but itâ€™s recommended to give your image a meaningful name (and optionally a version).

For example, if you wanted to add a version, you could tag it like this: `flask_app:v1.0`.

`.`: The period (dot) represents the current directory. It tells Docker to look for the Dockerfile in the current directory.

## Running a container

The command is used to run a Docker container from an image.

```docker
docker run -p 5000:5000 -v D:/medtronix-system/LexiAi/LexAi-3.0/lexai.db:/app/lexai.db flask_app
```

`docker run`: This command runs a container from a specified Docker image.

`-p 5000:5000`: This option maps port 5000 on your host machine (your computer) to port 5000 on the Docker container.

`-v D:/.../lexai.db`: This option is for mounting a volume. It maps a file or directory from your local system to a location inside the container.

- On the left side (`D:/.../lexai.db`), you specify the path to the SQLite database on your host machine.

- On the right side (`/app/lexai.db`), you specify the path inside the container where the SQLite database should be mounted.

`flask_app`: This is the name of the Docker image you're running.
