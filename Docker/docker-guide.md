## Introduction to Docker
Docker is an open-source platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of applications using containerization. Containers package an application and its dependencies into a single, lightweight unit, ensuring consistency across different environments (development, testing, production).

---

## Key Concepts

### Docker Images
A **Docker Image** is a read-only template that contains the instructions for creating a Docker container. It includes the application code, runtime, libraries, and dependencies required to run the application.

- Images are built using a `Dockerfile`.
- Images are stored in registries like **Docker Hub** or private repositories.

### Docker Containers
A **Docker Container** is a running instance of a Docker image. Containers are isolated from the host system and other containers, ensuring consistent behavior regardless of the environment.

- Containers are ephemeral, meaning they can be started, stopped, and destroyed without affecting the underlying image.
- Containers can communicate with each other through networks.

### Docker Volumes
**Docker Volumes** are used to persist data generated by and used by Docker containers. Unlike the container's filesystem, which is ephemeral, volumes persist even after the container is deleted.

- Volumes are ideal for storing databases, logs, or any data that needs to persist.
- They can also be used to share files between the host machine and the container during development.

## Setting Up Docker
Before proceeding, ensure Docker is installed on your system:
1. Download Docker Desktop from [Docker's official website](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).
2. Install Docker and verify the installation by running:
   ```bash
   docker --version
   ```
   This should display the installed Docker version.

## Building a Flask/FastAPI Application with Docker

### Step 1: Create a Flask/FastAPI App
1. Create a project directory:
   ```bash
   mkdir flask-fastapi-app
   cd flask-fastapi-app
   ```
2. Initialize a Python virtual environment and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install fastapi uvicorn
   ```
3. Create a file named `main.py` with the following content:
   ```python
   from fastapi import FastAPI

   app = FastAPI()

   @app.get("/")
   def read_root():
       return {"message": "Hello, Docker!"}
   ```

### Step 2: Write a Dockerfile
Create a `Dockerfile` in the project root:
```Dockerfile
# Base image
FROM python:3.9-slim

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy requirements file
COPY requirements.txt .

# Install dependencies
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy application code
COPY . .

# Expose port
EXPOSE 8000

# Command to run the application
CMD ["uvicorn", "main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]
```

Create a `requirements.txt` file:
```
fastapi
uvicorn
```

### Step 3: Build and Run the Docker Image
1. Build the Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t flask-fastapi-app .
   ```
2. Run the container:
   ```bash
   docker run -d -p 8000:8000 flask-fastapi-app
   ```
3. Access the app at `http://localhost:8000`.

### Step 4: Use Docker Volumes for Development
To enable live reloading during development, use Docker volumes to sync the local code with the container:
```bash
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 -v $(pwd):/app flask-fastapi-app
```

## Building a Next.js Application with Docker

### Step 1: Create a Next.js App
1. Create a project directory:
   ```bash
   mkdir nextjs-app
   cd nextjs-app
   ```
2. Initialize a Next.js app:
   ```bash
   npx create-next-app@latest .
   ```
3. Start the app locally to verify:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Step 2: Write a Dockerfile
Create a `Dockerfile` in the project root:
```Dockerfile
# Base image
FROM node:18-alpine

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package files
COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy application code
COPY . .

# Build the app
RUN npm run build

# Expose port
EXPOSE 3000

# Command to start the app
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

### Step 3: Build and Run the Docker Image
1. Build the Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t nextjs-app .
   ```
2. Run the container:
   ```bash
   docker run -d -p 3000:3000 nextjs-app
   ```
3. Access the app at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Step 4: Use Docker Volumes for Development
To enable live reloading during development, use Docker volumes:
```bash
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 -v $(pwd):/app nextjs-app
```
